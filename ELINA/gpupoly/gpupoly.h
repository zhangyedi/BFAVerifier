	/*! \name Verifies an image
	  Checks if an image (or more precisely, an input box) entirely classifies as a given label
	  Once this function has been called with a network, no additionnal layer should be added (i.e. it is necessary to clean and recreate a network)
	  It is of course possible to call this function multiple times on the same network.

	  Depending on GPUPoly configuration, this function can deliver different certification levels, listed here in increasing strength order:
		0. No certification: GPUPoly was not able to prove that the whole input box classifies as the given label.
		1. Certification without floating-point soundness. This yields no formal guarantee, but is in practice likely to mean 2.
		2. Certified for an infinitly precise evaluation. If a box is certified with this level, any element of the box will classify to the given label, as long as the inference is computed using infinitly precise arithmetic.
		3. Certified for an evaluation that uses double precision IEEE754 arithmetic, with any summation order and any rounding mode.
		4. Certified for an evaluation that uses single precision IEEE754 arithmetic, with any summation order and any rounding mode.

	  By default, GPUPoly tries to deliver level 3 or 4 certifications. The parameter soundness allows to disable floating-point soundness to speed up the computation (which then becomes roughly twice or three times faster). This mode doesn't offer any formal guarantee anymore, but yields in practice the same results. Without floating point soundness, GPUPoly outputs certification levels of 1.
	  Conversely, it is possible to make GPUPoly search for weaker certification levels using the `STRONG_FP_SOUNDNESS` compile option. If GPUPoly is compiled with this option, the letter `W` will appear after its version number (instead of `S`), and it will output certification levels of 1 and 2. If the floating-point soundness parameter is disabled, GPUPoly has the same behaviour with or without the `STRONG_FP_SOUNDNESS` option.
